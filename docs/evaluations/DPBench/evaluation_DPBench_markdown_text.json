Nonetheless, not all women from these groups are necessarily averse to women's issues.\n\n## Barriers to Filipino Women's Participation\n\nPrevious studies have identified political, economic, and cultural factors that impede women's participation in politics. However, context still matters since the perception of women's role in societies and the evolution of political systems differ. The following section examines some of these barriers.\n\nThe Philippine electoral system's \"first-past-the-post\" electoral type, coupled with the lack of well-developed political parties, inhibits women's entry into politics. Encinas-Franco (2021) argues that \"[w] ithout party discipline and institutionalized rules within parties, one"

To obtain an accurate measurement of the undisturbed water level above the crest of the weir, it is necessary to place the measuring gauge at a distance of at least three times the head above the weir.\n\n· Increase the flow by opening the bench regulating valve to set the heads above the datum level in 10 mm increments until the regulating valve is fully open. Take care not to allow spillage to occur over the plate top that is adjacent to the notch. At each condition, measure the flow rate and observe the shape of the nappe.\n\nNote: To obtain a sufficiently accurate result, collect around 25 liters of water each time, or collect the water for at least 120 seconds.\n\n- · Close the regulating valve, stop the pump, and then replace the weir with the V-notch.\n- · Repeat the experiment with the V-notch weir plate, but with 5 mm increments in water surface elevation.\n- · Collect seven head and discharge readings for each weir.\n\nFigure 9.3: Position of the notch and Vernier height gauge to set the datum.\n\n80 APPLIED FLUID MECHANICS LAB MANUAL"

Sample problem: If the ocular has a 10x lens and the objective has a 45x lens the total magnification is 10 x 45 = 450x\n\n## Changing objectives:\n\n- 1. When changing objectives from scanning power to lower power to high power the following changes will occur:\n- a. The size of the field of view decreases\n- b. The field of view becomes darker\n- c. The size of the image increases\n- d. The resolution (ability to see detail) increases\n- e. The working distance between the slide and the objective lens decreases\n- f. The depth of focus (thickness of the specimen that is visible) is reduced\n- 2. When changing from scanning to low power the field of view gets smaller. In fact, every time you increase the power of the objective, the field gets smaller.\n\n## Steps for Using the Microscope:\n\n- 1.

When changing objectives from scanning power to lower power to high power the following changes will occur:\n\n- a. The size of the field of view decreases b. The field of view becomes darker c. The size of the image increases d. The resolution (ability to see detail) increases e. The working distance between the slide and the objective lens decreases f. The depth of focus (thickness of the specimen that is visible) is reduced\n\n2. When changing from scanning to low power the field of view gets smaller.

The Tennessee Aquarium assisted with propagations and developed a program called \"Keeper Kids,\" where students on spring break help feed the Barrens Topminnows in a behind-the-scenes experience.\n\nFigure 6.3: Photo of the critically endangered Butterfly Splitfin (Ameca spendens).\n\nThe breeding colonies of the Butterfly Splitfin (Figure 6.3) at the London Zoo and elsewhere serve as ark populations essential to the survival of this species.

The Tennessee Aquarium is part of a large partnership to guide hatchery augmentation and recovery of the rarest darter in North America (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2019). The Conasauga Logperch (Percina jenkinsi), a federally endangered darter (Percidae), is found only in a 30-mile (48 km) stretch of the Conasauga River in Georgia and Tennessee (Moyer et al. 2015).\n\nFigure 6.4: Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens).\n\nThe Banggai Cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni), a small, endangered tropical cardinalfish in the family Apogonidae, is now bred and displayed in numerous public aquariums after overharvest in the wild drove wild populations to near extinction.

Although many individuals and organizations played roles, I concentrate on only two: Fly Fishers International (FFI) and Trout Unlimited (TU). These two organizations had similar interests in conservation, but important differences prevented them from working together on a unified goal of conservation. The legacy of fly-fishing demonstrates the importance of passion, persistence, and partnerships in fish conservation.\n\nTrout and salmon are the only sport fish native to the Western states, and fly-fishing here became more than a leisure activity. Norman Maclean's novel, A River Runs through It (1976), begins, 'In our family there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.' Later Maclean writes that 'Something within fishermen  tries to 1 make fishing into a world perfect and apart.' The iconography of Western fly-fishing that Maclean and others wrote about was created by anglers, fisheries managers, tourists, guides, businesses, and region promoters. The history of Rocky Mountain fly-fishing parallels the history of the expansion of our Western frontier as well as fisheries management (Brown 2015). Although Henry David Thoreau (1862) maintained that 'In wildness is the preservation of the world,' humans are part of the trout fishing system and helped create, destroy, maintain, and restore the trout fishing we have today.\n\nThe first trout fishers were Native Americans. Native Americans used a variety of fishing methods, including weirs, spears, nets, traps, baskets, hook-and-line methods, and baits. They also caught fish by hand via tickling. Tickling for trout involves rubbing the underbelly of a trout with fingers to get the trout to go into a trance, after which they can then easily be thrown onto the bank (Martindale 1901). Native Americans were more patient than others. This method is different from noodling for catfish, where the noodler uses fingers as bait and grabs the catfish by its mouth. Native Americans also caught fish by fly-fishing with deer-hair flies, according to the writings of early American naturalist William Bartram (1739-1823) (Monahan, no date).\n\nThe story of Rocky Mountain trout fishing begins with displacement of Native Americans from their historical fishing and hunting grounds. Uninhabited wilderness had to be created through the dispossession of Native people before it could be preserved (Spence 1999). Explorers, trappers, pioneers, soldiers, and homesteaders brought fishing gear to frontier outposts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) included a designated angler  named  Silas  Goodrich.  The  expedition  first  described  several  new  species  of  fish,  including  the Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout, caught by Goodrich.

Finally, since anglers have a variety of motivations, they likely respond differently to regulation changes (Beard et al. 2011).\n\nThe ethic of fairness is involved in setting creel limit regulations because many anglers do not harvest a single fish during an angling trip.

Flagship taxa are used as a symbol to promote conservation awareness (Caro 2010). Their large size makes them a true freshwater megafauna like crocodiles, river dolphins, and other large fish. Freshwater megafauna face many threats, and 71% of these species are in decline (He et al. 2017, 2018). Arapaima continue to face intense fishing throughout their range (Watson et al. 2021). However, freshwater megafauna like the Arapaima have fewer conservation resources and efforts than marine or terrestrial megafaunas.\n\nFishing,  in  general,  and  fishing  for Arapaim a  in  particular,  is  a  central  element  of  the  local  economy  and culture  in  Amazonia.  Because  these  fish  are obligate breathers,  they  are  traditionally  harvested  by  fishers using  harpoons  at  the  time  when  they  surface  to  breathe.  Men  typically  fish  from  canoes  and  search  for signs of Arapaima near the surface. As they near the Arapaima ,  the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand. This is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases their likelihood of catching one. With appropriate training, fishers' participation in management processes can contribute to the conservation and governance of these small-scale fisheries.\n\nMany populations of Arapaima have been driven to local extinction due to overfishing (Castello et al. 2015a; Gurdak 2019a; Watson et al. 2021; Freitas and Sousa 2021). Much of the catch is illegal, with most specimens being caught below the minimum size limit or during the closed season (Cavole et al. 2015). The small-scale fishers are geographically dispersed, and governments in these regions have insufficient resources to devote to enforcing fishing rules. The riverine fishers who target Arapaima are marginalized and have limited formal education. Yet, compliance with regulations is essential to prevent overfishing and local extinction.\n\nArapaima represent only a small fraction of the fisheries harvest, but they are culturally important and symbolic as a flagship genus of tropical South American fisheries and floodplain management and conservation. Reducing the threats to Arapaima will also provide protections for many of the highly migratory fish of the Amazon basin. Collectively, the migratory fish contribute most of the fishery's landings in the basin (Duponchelle et al. 2021). Migratory fish depend on multiple, distant, but interconnected habitats during their life cycle.

      "true_md": "Figure 11.2: Arapaima gigas displayed in the Siam Centre, Bangkok.\n\nArapaima is an important flagship genus for flooded forest ecosystem and human floodplain communities. Flagship taxa are used as a symbol to promote conservation awareness (Caro 2010). Their large size makes them a true freshwater megafauna like crocodiles, river dolphins, and other large fish. Freshwater megafauna face many threats, and 71% of these species are in decline (He et al. 2017, 2018). Arapaima continue to face intense fishing throughout their range (Watson et al. 2021). However, freshwater megafauna like the Arapaima have fewer conservation resources and efforts than marine or terrestrial megafaunas.\n\nFishing, in general, and fishing for Arapaima in particular, is a central element of the local economy and culture in Amazonia. Because these fish are obligate breathers, they are traditionally harvested by fishers using harpoons at the time when they surface to breathe. Men typically fish from canoes and search for signs of Arapaima near the surface. As they near the Arapaima, the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand. This is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases their likelihood of catching one. With appropriate training, fishers' participation in management processes can contribute to the conservation and governance of these small-scale fisheries.\n\nMany populations of Arapaima have been driven to local extinction due to overfishing (Castello et al. 2015a; Gurdak 2019a; Watson et al. 2021; Freitas and Sousa 2021). Much of the catch is illegal, with most specimens being caught below the minimum size limit or during the closed season (Cavole et al. 2015). The small-scale fishers are geographically dispersed, and governments in these regions have insufficient resources to devote to enforcing fishing rules. The riverine fishers who target Arapaima are marginalized and have limited formal education. Yet, compliance with regulations is essential to prevent overfishing and local extinction.\n\nArapaima represent only a small fraction of the fisheries harvest, but they are culturally important and symbolic as a flagship genus of tropical South American fisheries and floodplain management and conservation. Reducing the threats to Arapaima will also provide protections for many of the highly migratory fish of the Amazon basin. Collectively, the migratory fish contribute most of the fishery's landings in the basin (Duponchelle et al. 2021). Migratory fish depend on multiple, distant, but interconnected habitats during their life cycle. Any threat to one of the habitats or the corridor that connects them can influence these important food fish (Goulding et al. 2019).\n\nIntegrating Fishers in the Management of Arapaima | 251"

It required the addition of the designator to the section title prior to registration and then its removal after add/drop to ensure the label didn't appear on the student transcript. This process severely hampered our long- term reporting abilities. In total, four colleges adopted the #NOLO designator in this fashion.\n\nTo assist in greater faculty and institutional adoption as well as improve data capture, the CSCU OER Advisory Council made a formal recommendation to the provost's academic council in Spring 2018 to implement the #NOLO designator as a course section attribute within the student information system. In addition to adding a course section attribute, a student-facing course search filter was added as well as an additional column within the course search results page.\n\nFigure 2.1: Filtered Search Option for NOLO Sections.\n\nFigure 2.2: Added Column in Results for NOLO Designator.\n\nThe request to implement the designator within the student information system was supported in Fall 2018 by the president's cabinet. The ability to mark courses was enabled late Fall 2018 and the student-facing features were enabled in January 2019. Each institutional representative on the OER council engaged with their local governance structures to request a vote for adoption.\n\n4 BOYOUNG CHAE, KEVIN CORCORAN, MICHAEL DALY, ANN FIDDLER, JEFF GALLANT, JAMES GLAPA-GROSSKLAG, AMY HOFER, AND"

The reserve and salt-replaceable acidity controls the level of soluble or active acidity in the soil solution. Only the active acidity is measured in a routine pH determination. The reserve and saltreplaceable acidity is always many times higher than the active acidity.\n\nA soil is acid when hydrogen ions predominate in the soil. The degree of acidity is expressed in terms of pH, which is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. Therefore, the pH of a 0.01-molar hydrogen ion solution is\n\nAt pH 7, the concentration of H+ ions and OH- ions are equal, and the soil or solution is neutral. At pH values less than 7, the soil is acid; at values more than 7, the soil is alkaline. Most soils vary in pH from about 4 to 10. Soils in areas with high rainfall are generally acid with a pH less than 7. Soils developed in high-lime deposits often will be alkaline. Soils high in calcium seldom have pH values higher than 7.5, but the presence of large amounts of calcium carbonate may cause the pH to be as high as 8.5. Where the pH is higher than 8.5, an excess of sodium is highly probable.\n\nThe most desirable soil pH for most crops in Kansas is 6.8. However, crops like blueberries need a lower pH, and other crops, like alfalfa, need a higher pH. At soil pH less than 5.8, several problems may occur:\n\n- · Al and Mn toxicity\n- · Inhibited growth of N-fixing bacteria\n- · Possible deficiencies in Mg and/or Ca.\n- · P deficiency (P reacts with Fe and Al)\n- · At more than pH 7.5, other problems may occur:\n- · Deficiency of Fe, Mn, Cu, or Zn\n- · P deficiency (P reacts with Ca)\n\n## Buffering Capacity\n\nBuffering capacity is a measure of the soil's ability to resist a change in pH, directly related to the magnitude of the exchange capacity. Small fluctuations in acid or base content can occur without a noticeable pH change as cations are adsorbed or released from the exchange complex. Soils with the largest cation exchange capacity have the greatest buffering of a pH change. In other words, two soils may have the same pH (active acidity in soil solution), but the one with the largest cation exchange capacity will have the most acidity stored in reserve and therefore the highest buffering capacity or ability to resist a change in pH. For this reason, it takes less lime to increase the pH of a sandy soil (low CEC) by a given amount than it takes to increase the pH of a clay soil (higher CEC) the same amount.\n\n## Sources of Soil Acidity\n\nControlling soil pH is vital to optimal use and productivity of soils. Adding lime is the most effective and practical way to raise the pH of acid soils. Elemental sulfur, iron sulfate, or aluminum sulfate can be used to reduce soil pH. Because acidity is a concern in Kansas, we will focus on raising soil pH. Understanding the following equations should help you understand the sources of soil acidity and soil reactions to lime.\n\n124  |  Soil Acidity and Adjusting Soil pH",

      "true_md": "The acidic cations adsorbed on the negative exchange sites are called the reserve (also residual or potential) and salt- replaceable (also exchangeable) acidity. The reserve and salt-replaceable acidity controls the level of soluble or active acidity in the soil solution. Only the active acidity is measured in a routine pH determination. The reserve and salt- replaceable acidity is always many times higher than the active acidity.\n\nA soil is acid when hydrogen ions predominate in the soil. The degree of acidity is expressed in terms of pH, which is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. Therefore, the pH of a 0.01-molar hydrogen ion solution is\n\n$$\\mathrm{pH}=-\\log\\left(\\frac{10^{-2}\\mathrm{~mol}\\mathrm{H}^{+}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right)=2$$\n\nAt pH 7, the concentration of H+ ions and OH- ions are equal, and the soil or solution is neutral. At pH values less than 7, the soil is acid; at values more than 7, the soil is alkaline. Most soils vary in pH from about 4 to 10. Soils in areas with high rainfall are generally acid with a pH less than 7. Soils developed in high-lime deposits often will be alkaline.

This technique uses the principle of pH sensitivity of certain dyes, which cause differences in color across a range in pH. With the soils provided, complete the following pH determination:\n\nWeigh  10.0  g  of  soil  into  a  small  plastic  cup.  Add  20  ml  of  distilled  water  and  stir.

The pH meter measures the hydrogen ion activity [H ] + by measuring the electric potential across a thin, porous glass membrane at the base of the electrode. This potential changes in response to [H ], and by standardizing the instrument with buffers of known pH, we can measure the pH of + any solution, including soil solutions.\n\nUsing the samples prepared in Activity 1, carefully place the electrode in the suspension. Gently swirl the electrode in the solution, and note the pH reading. Wait for the pH meter to reach a steady reading, indicated by the word 'ready' on the screen.\n\nRecord the value for this 1:2 soil-water suspension in Table 14.1.\n\nSoil Acidity and Adjusting Soil pH  |  127",

Inspired by recent efforts to efficiently up-scale LLMs, we present a method for scaling LLMs called depth up-scaling (DUS), which encompasses depthwise scaling and continued pretraining. In contrast to other LLM up-scaling methods that use mixture-of-experts, DUS does not require complex changes to train and inference efficiently.

In- spired by recent efforts to efficiently up-scale LLMs, we present a method for scaling LLMs called depth up-scaling (DUS), which encom- passes depthwise scaling and continued pre- training. In contrast to other LLM up-scaling methods that use mixture-of-experts, DUS does not require complex changes to train and infer- ence efficiently. We show experimentally that DUS is simple yet effective in scaling up high- performance LLMs from small ones.

To efficiently tackle the above, recent works in scaling language models such as a mixture of experts (MoE) (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022) have been pro- posed.

DUS consists of scaling the base model along the depth dimension and continually pretraining the scaled model.

While existing methods such as Komatsuzaki et al. (2022) use MoE(Shazeer et al., 2017) to scale-up the model architecture, we opt for a different depthwise scaling strategy inspired by Tan and Le (2019). We then continually pretrain the scaled model as just scaling the model without further pretraining degrades the performance.\n\nBase model. Any n -layer transformer architecture can be used but we select the 32-layer Llama 2 architecture as our base model. We initialize the Llama 2 architecture with pretrained weights from Mistral 7B, as it is one of the top performers compatible with the Llama 2 architecture. By adopting the Llama 2 architecture for our base model, we aim to leverage the vast pool of community resources while introducing novel modifications to further enhance its capabilities.\n\nDepthwise scaling. From the base model with n layers, we set the target layer count s for the scaled model, which is largely dictated by the available hardware.\n\nWith the above, the depthwise scaling process is as follows. The base model with n layers is duplicated for subsequent modification. Then, we remove the final m layers from the original model and the initial m layers from its duplicate, thus forming two distinct models with n -m layers. These two models are concatenated to form a scaled model with s = 2 ( · n -m ) layers. Note that n = 32 from our base model and we set s = 48 considering our hardware constraints and the efficiency of the scaled model, i.e., fitting between 7 and 13 billion parameters. Naturally, this leads to the removal of m = 8 layers. The depthwise scaling process with n = 32 , s = 48 , and m = 8 is depicted in 'Step 1: Depthwise Scaling' of Fig. 1.\n\nWenote that a method in the community that also scale the model in the same manner 2 as 'Step 1: Depthwise Scaling' of Fig. 1 has been concurrently developed.\n\nContinued pretraining. The performance of the depthwise scaled model initially drops below that of the base LLM. Thus, we additionally apply the continued pretraining step as shown in 'Step 2: Continued Pretraining' of Fig. 1. Experimentally, we observe rapid performance recovery of the scaled model during continued pretraining, a phenomenon also observed in Komatsuzaki et al. (2022). We consider that the particular way of depthwise scaling has isolated the heterogeneity in the scaled model which allowed for this fast performance recovery.\n\nDelving deeper into the heterogeneity of the scaled model, a simpler alternative to depthwise scaling could be to just repeat its layers once more, i.e., from n to 2 n layers. Then, the 'layer distance', or the difference in the layer indices in the base model, is only bigger than 1 where layers n and n +1 are connected, i.e., at the seam.\n\nHowever, this results in maximum layer distance at the seam, which may be too significant of a discrepancy for continued pretraining to quickly resolve. Instead, depthwise scaling sacrifices the 2 m middle layers, thereby reducing the discrepancy at the seam and making it easier for continued\n\n2 https://huggingface.co/Undi95/ Mistral-11B-v0.1",

In the instruction tuning stage, the model is trained to follow instructions in a QA format (Zhang et al., 2023b). We mostly use open-source datasets but also synthesize a math QA dataset to enhance the model's mathematical capabilities. A rundown of how we crafted the dataset is as follows. First, seed math data are collected from the Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset only, to avoid contamination with commonly used benchmark datasets such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Then, using a process similar to MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023), we rephrase the questions and answers of the seed math data. We use the resulting rephrased question-answer pairs as a QA dataset\n\nAlignment tuning. In the alignment tuning stage, the instruction-tuned model is further fine-tuned to be more aligned with human or strong AI ( e.g., GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023)) preferences using direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). Similar to the instruction tuning stage, we use mostly open-source datasets but also synthesize a math-focused alignment dataset utilizing the 'Synth. Math-Instruct' dataset mentioned in the instruction tuning stage.\n\nThe alignment data synthesis process is as follows. We take advantage of the fact that the rephrased question-answer pairs in Synth. Math-Instruct data are beneficial in enhancing the model's mathematical capabilities (see Sec. 4.3.1). Thus, we speculate that the rephrased answer to the rephrased question is a better answer than the original answer, possibly due to the interim rephrasing step. Consequently, we set the rephrased question as the prompt and use the rephrased answer as the chosen response and the original answer as the rejected response and create the {prompt, chosen, rejected} DPO tuple. We aggregate the tuples from the rephrased question-answer pairs and call the resulting dataset 'Synth. Math-Alignment'.\n\n## 4 Results\n\n## 4.1 Experimental Details\n\nTraining datasets.

In the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023), six types of evaluation methods are presented: ARC (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSWAG (Zellers et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). We utilize these datasets as benchmarks for evaluation and also re- port the average scores for the six tasks, e.g., H6.\n\nModel merging. Model merging methods such as Yadav et al. (2023) can boost model perfor- mance without further training. We merge some of the models that we trained in both the instruc- tion and alignment tuning stages. We implement our own merging methods although popular open source also exist such as MergeKit3.\n\n## 4.2 Main Results\n\nWe present evaluation results for our SOLAR 10.7B and SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct models along with other top-performing models in Tab. 2. SO- LAR 10.7B outperforms other pretrained models of similar sizes, such as Qwen 14B and Mistral 7B, which shows that DUS is an effective method to up-scale base LLMs. Furthermore, despite the\n\nsmaller size, SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct scores the highest in terms of H6, even surpassing the recent top-performing open-source LLM Mixtral 8×7B- Instruct-v0.1 or Qwen 72B. The above results indi- cate DUS can up-scale models that are capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine- tuned. We also report data contamination results for SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct in Appendix C.\n\n## 4.3 Ablation Studies\n\nWe present ablation studies for both the instruction and alignment tuning stages.\n\n## 4.3.1 Instruction Tuning\n\nAblation on the training datasets. We present ablation studies using different training datasets for the instruction tuning in Tab. 3. The ablated models are prefixed with SFT for supervised fine- tuning. 'SFT v1' only uses the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, whereas 'SFT v2' also uses the OpenOrca dataset. 'SFT v3' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v2'. Similarly, 'SFT v4' uses the Synth. Math-Instruct dataset along with the datasets used in 'SFT v1'.\n\nFirst, we analyze how Alpaca-GPT4 and OpenOrca affect the trained models. The first ab- lated model, 'SFT v1', which used only the Alpaca- GPT4 dataset for training, resulted in 69.15 for H6. When we add the OpenOrca dataset to train the second ablated model, 'SFT v2', the resulting H6 score is 69.21, which is little change from 69.15 of 'SFT v1'. However, the task scores vary more as 'SFT v2' gets a substantially higher GSM8K score of 57.32 compared to 52.24 of 'SFT v1' but also gets noticeably lower scores across the board for ARC, HellaS wag, and TruthfulQA.

This has led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike previous language models, LLMs possess the ability for In-context learning, including Zero-shot learning (Radford et al., 2019) and Few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020), allowing them to perform new tasks without updating model weights. These capabilities of LLMs, not evident in smaller models, are referred to as Emergent abilities (Wei et al., 2022a).\n\n## B.2 Mixture of Experts\n\nIn the landscape of machine learning architectures, the Mixture of Experts (MoE) models like (Shazeer et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022) has gained attention for its capability to address the challenges posed by complex and heterogeneous data. MoE models offer notable benefits, including enhanced output diversity, allowing for the capture of intricate patterns within the input space. Moreover, their computational efficiency, especially when implemented in a sparse form, has made them valuable in scenarios where resource constraints are a consideration (Shazeer et al., 2017; Komatsuzaki et al., 2022).\n\nHowever, efficient implementation of MoE models poses a considerable challenge, primarily due to the intricacies associated with dynamic routing and load-imbalanced computation (Gale et al., 2023). Existing hardware and software for deep learning, such as TPUs and XLA compilers, often demand static knowledge of tensor shapes, making MoE implementation on TPU challenging.\n\nWhile GPU implementation offers more flexibility, sparse computation compatibility becomes a hurdle. Striking the right balance between fixing the size of each expert to facilitate efficient computation and maintaining model quality creates a tradeoff between information preservation and hardware efficiency. This tradeoff, in turn, necessitates careful consideration during hyperparameter tuning, adding a layer of complexity to the implementation of MoE models, potentially offsetting their advantages.

Not only that, DUS also undergoes continued pretraining to quickly recover performance of the scaled model.\n\n## B.3 Prompt Engineering\n\nA key research area to harness the emergent abilities of LLMs is prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the study of how to design inputs (prompts) that enable LLMs to better perform specific tasks. A prime example of this research is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b), which proposes CoT prompting that decomposes multi-step problems into a series of intermediate reasoning steps. Moreover, efforts are underway to replace even such prompt engineering with LLMs (Yang et al., 2023).\n\n## B.4 Instruction Tuning\n\nTo enhance the steerability of LLMs, instruction tuning (Wei et al., 2021) has emerged as a learning technique. This involves fine-tuning LLMs using data formatted as (instruction, input, output) for various tasks (Wang et al., 2022). Instruction tuning allows for targeted adjustments, providing a more controlled and task-oriented improvement to the model's capabilities.\n\nBefore instruction tuning, existing methods faced challenges in effectively guiding and controlling the behavior of large language models (Zhang et al., 2023b). The sheer complexity of these models made it difficult to ensure precise and taskoriented responses. The need for a more targeted approach arose from the limitations of existing methods, leading to the development of instruction tuning. This targeted approach enables better control over the model's behavior, making it more suitable for specific tasks and improving its overall performance in alignment with user-defined objectives. Therefore, instruction tuning is computationally efficient and facilitates the rapid adaptation of LLMs to a specific domain without requiring extensive retraining or architectural changes.\n\n## B.5 Alignment Tuning\n\nLLM has been observed to generate sentences that may be perceived as linguistically incongruent by human readers since they learned not human intention, but only vast knowledge across various domains in the pretraining step (Ziegler et al., 2019).\n\nTo overcome this limitation and align with human intentions, previous research (Ziegler et al., 2019) have proposed Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF operates by learning a reward model based on human preferences, employing reinforcement learning to guide the LLM towards prioritizing answers with the highest reward scores. This process enhances the safety, propriety, and overall quality of the generated responses. Despite demonstrating satisfactory performance, RLHF encounters challenges such as managing numerous hyperparameters and necessitating the incorporation of multiple models (policy, value, reward, and reference models).\n\nIn response to these challenges, the supervised fine-tuning based approaches have proposed, such as Rank Responses to align Human Feedback (RRHF) (Yuan et al., 2023), Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Intel, 2023). They avoid the complexities associated with reinforcement learning while achieving empirical performance comparable to RLHF. Among them, DPO that we used directly guides the LLM to increase the probability of positive responses and decrease the probability of negative responses through a \"direct\" approach. Interestingly, DPO demonstrates more stable learning results compared to RLHF, despite its simple training approach.\n\n## B.6 Data Contamination\n\nRecent researches (Zhou et al., 2023; Sainz et al., 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Deng et al., 2023) emphasize the need to measure whether a specific benchmark was used to train the large language models. There are three types of the data contamination: guideline, raw text and annotation (Sainz et al., 2023). Guideline contamination occurs when a model accesses detailed annotation guidelines for a dataset, providing advantages in specific tasks, and its impact should be considered, especially in zero and few-shot evaluations. Raw text contamination occurs when a model has access to the original text. Wikipedia is widely used as a pretraining data, but also as a source for creating new datasets. The caution is advised in the development of automatically annotated datasets sourced from the web. Annotation contamination occurs when the annotations of the specific benchmark are exposed during model training.",
