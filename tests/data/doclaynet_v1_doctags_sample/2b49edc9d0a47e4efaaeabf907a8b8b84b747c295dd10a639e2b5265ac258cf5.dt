<text><loc_35><loc_236><loc_442><loc_246>The substitutional portion of the benefits under the WPPF has been included in the amounts shown in the above table.</text>
<text><loc_35><loc_246><loc_442><loc_306>The Company received the approval from the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare ('MLHW') in the year ended March 31, 2003 with respect to its application for exemption from the obligation for benefits related to future employee services under the substitutional portion of the WPPF. Certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries received the same approval from MLHW during the year ended March 31, 2004. In accordance with the transitional provision stipulated in "Practical Guidelines for Accounting for Retirement Benefits", the Company and the domestic consolidated subsidiaries accounted for the separation of the substitutional portion of the benefit obligation from the corporate portion of the benefit obligation under their WPPFs as of the dates of approval for their exemption assuming that the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of the benefit obligation and related pension plan assets has been completed as of those dates. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $3,945,945 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 and the domestic consolidated subsidiaries recognized an aggregate gain of $3,669 million and an aggregate loss of $1,587 million for the year ended March 31, 2004. The pension assets to be transferred were calculated at $3,757,770 million for the domestic consolidated subsidiaries at March 31, 2004 and $241,203 million for the Company at March 31, 2003.</text>
