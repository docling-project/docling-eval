To this end, the pilot must carefully evaluate airplane and power- plant performance and judge the acceleration of the airplane by the use of "line speeds." The accelerated motion of the airplane during takeoff roll will define certain relationships be- tween velocity and distance when the acceler- ation of the airplane is normal. By comparison of predicted and actual speeds at various points along the runway, the pilot can evaluate the acceleration and assess the takeoff perform- ance.</text>
<text><loc_26><loc_173><loc_224><loc_308>An example of an acceleration profile is shown by the second illustration of figure 6.12, where the variation of velocity and distance is defined for the case of uniformly accelerated motion, i.e., constant acceleration. While the case of uniformly accelerated motion doesnot correspond exactly to the takeoff performance of all airplanes, it is sufficiently applicable to illustrate the principle of line speeds and al- celeration checks. If the takeoff acceleration of the airplane were constant, the airplane would develop specific percentages of the take- off speed at specific percentages of the takeoff distance. Representative values from figure 6.12 are as follows:</text>

<text><loc_22><loc_371><loc_224><loc_413>As an example of this uniformly accelerated motion, the airplane upon reaching the half- way point of takeoff roll would have spent 70.7 percent of the total takeoff time and ac- celerated to 70.7 percent of the takeoff speed.</text>
<text><loc_22><loc_414><loc_224><loc_471>If the airplane has not reached a specific speed at a specific distance, it is obvious that the ac- celeration is below the predicted value and the airplane surely will not achieve the takeoff speed in the specified takeoff distance. Therefore, properly computed line speeds at various</text>
<text><loc_243><loc_54><loc_445><loc_116>points along the runway will allow the pilot to monitor the takeoff performance and recog- nize a deficiency of acceleration. Of course, a deficiency of acceleration must be recognized prior to reaching some point along the runway where takeoff cannot be safely achieved or refused.</text>
<text><loc_243><loc_117><loc_445><loc_301>The fundamental principles of refusal speeds and line speeds are applicable equally well to single-engine and multingene airplanes. How- ever, in the case of the multingene airplane additional consideration must be given to the decision to continue or refuse takeoff when engine failure occurs during the takeoff roll. If failure of one engine occurs prior to reaching the refusal speed, takeoff should be discon- nued and the airplane brought to a stop on the remaining runway. If failure of one engine occurs after exceeding the refusal speed, the airplane is committed to continue takeoff with the remaining engines operative or an unsafe caused takeoff. In some cases, the remaining runway may not be sufficient to allow acceleration to the takeoff speed and the airplane can either takeoff or stop on the runway remain- ing. To facilitate consideration of this prob- lem, several specific definitions are necessary.</text>
<text><loc_243><loc_302><loc_445><loc_408>(1) Takeoff and initial climb speed: A speed, usually a fixed percentage above the stall speed, a which the airplane will become airborne and best clear obstacles immediately after takeoff. For a particular airplane in the takeoff con- figuration, this speed (in EAs or CAS) is a function of gross weight but in no circumstances should it be less than the minimum directional control speed for the critical asymmetrical power condition. Generally, the takeoff and initial climb speed is referred to as the "Vz" speed.</text>
<text><loc_243><loc_409><loc_445><loc_471>(2) Critical engine failure speed: A speed achieved during the takeoff roll at which fail- ure of one engine will require the same distance to continue accelerating with the operative en- gines to accomplish safe takeoff or refuse takeoff and decelerate to a stop utilizing the airplane brakes. At critical engine failure</text>
