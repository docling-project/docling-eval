<text><loc_53><loc_58><loc_248><loc_145>horizontal wells drilled just to the Bossier may not always hold Haynesville rights. Therefore, Chesapeake and other producers have been drilling aggressively to hold all rights through the Haynesville before the initial three-year term of a typical lease expires. As a result, there has not been much drilling to the Bossier to date. However, once our leases are held by production (HBP) by Haynesville drilling (we expect to be largely complete with HBP drilling by year-end 2011 and completely finished by year-end 2012). We will begin developing the Bossier Shale more aggressively in 2013. In the Bossier play, we own 205,000 net leasehold acres and estimate we could drill up to 2,600 net wells in the years ahead.</text>

<text><loc_53><loc_372><loc_248><loc_449>Marcellus Shale - We first became aware of the Marcellus in 2005 when we were negotiating our $2.2 billion acquisition of Appalachia's second-largest natural gas producer, Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. In 2007 we aggressively accelerated our Marcellus leasehold acquisition efforts and began to prepare for our first drilling activities. By early 2008, we had determined the Marcellus could be prospective over an area of approximately 15 million net acres (approximately five times larger than the prospective Haynesville core area and 10 times larger than the Barnett core area).</text>
<text><loc_53><loc_451><loc_248><loc_467>After acquiring 1.8 million net leasehold acres, we entered into a joint venture agreement in late 2008 with Oso-based Statoil, one of the</text>
<text><loc_262><loc_58><loc_456><loc_136>largest and most respected European energy companies. In this transaction, we sold Statoil 32.5% of our Marcellus assets for $3.375 billion in cash and drilling carries. Today, having sold 32.5% of our original 1.8 million net leasehold acres, we have returned to owning 1.7 million net leasehold acres in the play and are the industry's leading leasehold owner, largest producer and most active developer. We are producing from more than 100 net wells in the Marcellus on our 1.7 million net acres, are currently drilling with 32 rigs and estimate we could drill up to 21,000 additional net wells in the years ahead.</text>

<text><loc_298><loc_204><loc_456><loc_300>The very significant upward trajectory of value creation that Chesapeake is on today is primarily driven by the quality of our assets, which feature dominant positions in 16 of the 20 most important major unconventional natural gas and liquids plays in the U.S.</text>
<text><loc_298><loc_327><loc_456><loc_388>for the company to find other liquids-rich plays in 2010. The Granite Wash, and other plays with liquids-rich gas production streams, provide the strongest economics in the industry today because they possess the best of both worlds: high-volume natural gas production along with significant volumes of highly valued liquids that dramatically increase investment returns.</text>
<text><loc_262><loc_390><loc_456><loc_467>We are producing from approximately 150 net Granite Wash wells, are currently drilling with 16 rigs and estimate we could drill up to 1,700 additional net wells on our 215,000 net leasehold acres in the years ahead. Based on current NYMEX futures prices for natural gas and oil, each Granite Wash well should generate approximately $11.5 million of present value (or up to an undiscounted total of $19.5 billion for all 1,700 wells), making it obvious why finding, leasing and developing more unconventional liquids-rich plays was Chesapeake's number one priority for 2010. We were very successful</text>
